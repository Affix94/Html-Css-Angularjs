    "description": "A thorough redo of the Boxster is here, though after spending a week with the outgoing Spyder, we have to conclude that nothing needed fixing. A close kin to the Cayman GT4, the Spyder is a limited-production model that borrows the 911’s engine.The hand-me-down six comes from the older 911 Carrera S, not to be confused with the new turbocharged 3.0-liter flat-six that powers the refreshed 911. We love the old naturally aspirated 3.8-liter, even here, in its detuned, 375-hp state. It has just the right amount of snarl from the intake and a deep metallic rasp from the standard sport exhaust. This engine gives new meaning to talking behind your back.",
