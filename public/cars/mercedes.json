    "description": "Breathtakingly expensive, hugely powerful, and anachronistic in looks, this is not for the shy. With roots going back to 1979, the G63 retains its basic fashionista-meets-Sandinista look. Its twin-turbo 5.5-liter V-8 makes 563 hp and 561 lb-ft and mates to a seven-speed automatic. Mercedes’ all-wheel-drive system, 4MATIC, is standard. The G65 turns up the crazy even more with a twin-turbo 6.0-liter V-12 that makes 621 hp and 738 lb-ft. Note: These models replace the Mercedes-Benz versions.",
