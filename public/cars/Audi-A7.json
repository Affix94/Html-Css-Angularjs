    "description": "If you’re looking for a handsome, curvaceous car that is capable in all kinds of weather, check out the A7. Its sole powertrain is a 333-hp 3.0-liter supercharged V-6, with all-wheel drive and an eight-speed automatic. Tastefully appointed with first-rate materials, the interior is one of the best in the industry. Handling is responsive, brakes are powerful. It may be pricey, but we think it’s worth it. 2015 and 2016 TDI diesels have been stop-saled until further notice due to EPA violations.",
