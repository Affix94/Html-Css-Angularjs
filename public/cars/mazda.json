    "description": " The Mazda 3 is again the brand’s entry-level model (now that the 2 is being sold as a Toyota) and also one of the best small cars. Like the Volkswagen Golf with which it competes, it’s a stalwart of our 10Best Cars list. As Mazda’s budget leader, not every 3 comes loaded with features, but even the base 155-hp 2.0-liter sedan delivers pleasing dynamic behavior, solid build quality, and impressive fuel economy. Upgrading to the 3 s model brings a 184-hp 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with more thrust, nets standard features such as heated leather seats, and makes available options that include active safety features. It is offered with a choice of automatic or manual transmissions in a pair of four-door body styles: sedan or hatchback.",
