    "description": "Affluent driving enthusiasts will be delighted by the 7-series, both for its lap-of-luxury cabin and its surprising agility when the road gets twisty. The 320-hp 3.0-liter turbo inline-six is more than adequate, but the 445-hp 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8 really hustles. Rear-drive and an eight-speed automatic are standard; all-wheel drive is optional with the V-8. The interior allows for maximum relaxation and is loaded with technology. For the ultimate 7, check out the Alpina B7 with 600 hp.",
